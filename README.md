## DX Features

- **Vue 3** for building reactive UIs.
- **Storybook** for components preview.
- **ESLint** for maintaining code quality and consistency (instead of prettier)
- **Automatic import and component registration** using `unplugin-auto-import` and `unplugin-vue-components`.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following requirements:

- **Proto**: The toolchain for managing Node.js versions. Install it from [Proto](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/proto/install).
- **Node.js**: Managed by `proto`, which enforces the latest LTS version *(v20.9.0)*.
- **pnpm**: For managing dependencies. Install it from [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

   ```bash
   cd optipilot
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

## Available Scripts

- **`pnpm dev`**: Builds the project in a development watch mode, usable for working in an extension mode.

  ```

- **`pnpm serve`**: Serves the project as a frontend application, has a limitation of extension API-s not being available.

  ```bash
  pnpm serve
  ```

- **`pnpm components`**: Starts the Storybook server for developing components.
